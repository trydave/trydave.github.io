							<h2> Spatial Transportation Infrastructure, Energy, Vehicle and Emissions Model (STIEVE) for California </h2>
							<p align="justify"> STIEVE model is capable of producing spatially detailed transportation scenarios for cars and trucks across several thousand geographic districts 
							within the state and solving for the optimal configuration of refueling stations to meet the energy demand of these vehicles. STIEVE produces projections 
							of hydrogen refueling demand and station needs on a spatial basis, using a “Transportation Analysis Zones (TAZ)'' level of detail. There are a total of 
							5454 TAZs within inland California utilized in this study. TAZs are identified by traffic modelers as areas having roughly homogenous travel characteristics.
							<br>
							The model, as shown in Figure below, works in three steps: estimating the demand for hydrogen fuel based on the shortest distance travel pattern of current 
							vehicle stock, finding the optimal number and size of stations within the driving range covering the maximum demand, and performing suitability analysis 
							using various geospatial data for the station deployment on the ground.
