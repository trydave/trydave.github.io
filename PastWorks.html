							<h2> Mobile MMS – UAV MMS integration technique based on image pairing method for precise geospatial information construction in urban area </h2>
							<p align="justify"> In order to provide a real-time system for mapping urban areas, this project developed a method combining mobile mapping systems and data collected from unmanned aerial vehicles. This research provided an accurate and useful method of mapping urban locations with the benefit of low effort and time required for map production, which is a dramatic improvement on previous unreliable and time-consuming methods.
